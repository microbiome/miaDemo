This workshop introduces the _miaverse_, a _SummarizedExperiment_
framework tailored for microbiome data science. Participants will gain
hands-on experience with the
_TreeSummarizedExperiment_ class, which is central to the _miaverse_
framework. In this session, we will also learn how to utilize _miaverse_ methods
and navigate the
[Orchestrating Microbiome Analysis (OMA) online book](https://microbiome.github.io/OMA/docs/devel/)
for additional resource.

We will start with a brief overview of the framework, followed by an
instructor-led live demonstration. The demonstration will showcase selected
key features and functionalities of miaverse. After the demo, participant
will have time to discuss the framework, ask questions, and explore the tools
and methods covered.

By the end of the workshop, attendees will have a understanding of how to
apply the miaverse framework to their microbiome research and will be
well-prepared to further explore the framework independently.
