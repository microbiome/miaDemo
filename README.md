# mia workshop in EuroBioC2024 <img src="vignettes/figures/mia_logo.png" align="right" width="120" />

Learn how _miaverse_
integrates microbiome data science with the _SummarizedExperiment_ ecosystem,
and discover the benefits this brings. We will cover key methods, explore
[the OMA online book](https://microbiome.github.io/OMA/docs/devel), and discuss
the integration's advantages.

We will start with a brief overview of the framework, followed by an
instructor-led live demonstration. The demonstration will showcase selected
key features and functionalities of _miaverse_. After the demo, participant
will have time to discuss the framework, ask questions, and explore the tools
and methods covered.

By the end of the workshop, attendees will have a understanding of how to
apply the framework to their microbiome research and will be
well-prepared to further explore the framework independently.
