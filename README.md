This workshop introduces the miaverse framework, a powerful tool within the
_SummarizedExperiment_ framework designed specifically for microbiome data
science. Participants will gain hands-on experience with the
_TreeSummarizedExperiment_ class, which is central to the _miaverse_
framework. The session will also cover how to utilize the methods available
and navigate the
[Orchestrating Microbiome Analysis (OMA) online book](https://microbiome.github.io/OMA/docs/devel/)
for additional resources.

We will start with a brief overview of the framework, followed by an
instructor-led live demonstration. The demonstration will showcase selected
key features and functionalities of miaverse. After the demo, participant
will have time to discuss the framework, ask questions, and explore the tool
and methods covered.

By the end of the workshop, attendees will have a understanding of how to
apply the miaverse framework to their microbiome data analysis and will be
well-prepared to further explore the framework independently.
