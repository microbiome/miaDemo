## Overview

### Description

This workshop introduces the miaverse framework, a powerful tool within the
_SummarizedExperiment_ framework designed specifically for microbiome data
science. Participants will gain hands-on experience with the
_TreeSummarizedExperiment_ class, which is central to the _miaverse_
framework. The session will also cover how to utilize the methods available
and navigate the
[Orchestrating Microbiome Analysis (OMA) online book](https://microbiome.github.io/OMA/docs/devel/)
for additional resources.

We will start with a brief overview of the framework, followed by an
instructor-led live demonstration. The demonstration will showcase selected
key features and functionalities of miaverse. After the demo, participant
will have time to discuss the framework, ask questions, and explore the tool
and methods covered.

By the end of the workshop, attendees will have a understanding of how to
apply the miaverse framework to their microbiome data analysis and will be
well-prepared to further explore the framework independently.

### Pre-requisites

* Basic knowledge of R syntax
* Familiarity with Bioconductor
* Understanding of microbiome data science

If your time allows, we recommend to spend some time to explore
[Orchestrating Microbiome Analysis (OMA) online book](https://microbiome.github.io/OMA/docs/devel/).

### Participation

Participants are encouraged to ask questions at any time during the workshop
to facilitate a more interactive learning experience. The workshop will
follow a demo from the
[OMA online book](https://microbiome.github.io/OMA/docs/devel/pages/introductory_workflow.html),
and participants will be guided through hands-on exercises.

To ensure a smooth experience, Bioconductor provides
[pre-installed virtual machines with all necessary packages](https://workshop.bioconductor.org/).
These machines will allow participants to run the workshop exercises and
follow along with the instructor.

### _R_ / _Bioconductor_ packages used

In this workshop, we will focus on the usage of the
[_mia_ package](https://bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/html/mia.html),
which is designed for microbiome data science. This package is part of the
Bioconductor project and provides essential tools for analyzing and visualizing
microbiome data using the _SummarizedExperiment_ framework.

- **Explore documentation**: Navigate the OMA online book for additional tools and methods.

## Workshop

### 1 Background

The _SummarizedExperiment_ (_SE_) is a widely used data container in Bioconductor,
applicable across various fields. It fosters synergy by enabling the use of
shared methods and standardized formats, which facilitates collaborative
research and reduces redundant efforts.

```{r se_structure, fig.align = 'center', out.width = "80%", fig.cap = "_SummarizedExperiment_ class", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("vignettes", "figures", "SE.png"))
```

However, microbiome data science relied on alternative approaches. To
integrate microbiome data science within the _SE_ ecosystem, the
_TreeSummarizedExperiment_ (_TreeSE_) was developed.

```{r treese_structure, fig.align = 'center', out.width = "80%", fig.cap = "_TreeSummarizedExperiment_ class", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("vignettes", "figures", "TreeSE.png"))
```

Subsequently, a suite of _mia_* (MIcrobiome Analysis) packages was developed to
offer microbiome-specific methods within the _SE_ ecosystem:

- [_mia_](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/mia.html): Data analysis.
- [_miaViz_](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/miaViz.html): Visualization.
- [_miaSim_](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/miaSim.html): Data simulation.
- [_miaTime_](https://github.com/microbiome/miaTime): Time series analysis (coming soon to Bioconductor).

The framework has been further expanded by various independent developers,
introducing a range of additional methods. For more details, see
[OMA](https://microbiome.github.io/OMA/docs/devel/pages/miaverse.html#sec-packages).

To support microbiome data science, the online book
[Orchestrating Microbiome Analysis with Bioconductor (OMA)](https://microbiome.github.io/OMA/docs/devel)
was created. It aims to help users conduct microbiome data science by providing
examples and best practices developed through collaborative efforts. The book
will soon be published on Bioconductor.

### 2 Demonstration

In this demo, we will follow
[the introductory workflow from OMA](https://microbiome.github.io/OMA/docs/devel/pages/introductory_workflow.html)
by copy-pasting code examples provided there. The goal is not only to
familiarize participants with the _TreeSE_ and related methods but also to introduce
them to OMA, supporting their learning beyond the workshop.

### 3 Q&A and free exploration

Time for questions. You are also encouraged to explore and run examples from
[OMA](https://microbiome.github.io/OMA/docs/devel/) on your own.
