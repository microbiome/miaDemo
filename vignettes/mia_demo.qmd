## Overview

### Description

Learn how _miaverse_ framework
integrates microbiome data science with the _SummarizedExperiment_ ecosystem,
and discover the benefits this brings. We will cover key methods, explore
[the OMA online book](https://microbiome.github.io/OMA/docs/devel), and discuss
the integration's advantages.

We will start with a brief overview of the framework, followed by an
instructor-led live demonstration. The demonstration will showcase selected
key features and functionalities of _miaverse_. After the demo, participant
will have time to discuss the framework, ask questions, and explore the tools
and methods covered.

By the end of the workshop, attendees will have a understanding of how to
apply the framework to their microbiome research and will be
well-prepared to further explore the framework independently.

### Pre-requisites

* Basic knowledge of R coding
* Familiarity with Bioconductor
* Understanding of microbiome research

If your time allows, we recommend to spend some time to explore beforehand
[Orchestrating Microbiome Analysis (OMA) online book](https://microbiome.github.io/OMA/docs/devel/).

### Participation

Participants are encouraged to ask questions throughout the workshop. The
session will follow
[a tutorial from the OMA online book](https://microbiome.github.io/OMA/docs/devel/pages/introductory_workflow.html),
with participants running the tutorial alongside the instructor.

To facilitate this, Bioconductor provides
[pre-installed virtual machines with all necessary packages](https://workshop.bioconductor.org/).

### _R_ / _Bioconductor_ packages used

In this workshop, we will focus on
[the _mia_ package](https://bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/html/mia.html),
which is designed for microbiome data science. The _mia_ package provides
essential tools for analyzing microbiome data using the
_SummarizedExperiment_ framework.

### Workshop goals and objectives

#### Learning goals

- **Methods for microbiome analysis**: Learn to harness _SummarizedExperiment_ ecosystem in your project.

- **Data structure**: Understand how to utilize the _TreeSummarizedExperiment_ class for effective microbiome data analysis.

- **Access resources**: Get familiar with additional tools and resources, including [the OMA online book](https://microbiome.github.io/OMA/docs/devel).

#### Learning objectives

- **Analyze and apply methods**:  Apply the framework to process and analyze microbiome data.

- **Create visualizations**: Generate and interpret visualizations.

- **Explore documentation**: Use the [OMA](https://microbiome.github.io/OMA/docs/devel) to explore additional tools and methods.

## Workshop

### 1 Background

The _SummarizedExperiment_ class is a cornerstone of Bioconductor, facilitating
standardized data management across various research domains. It promotes synergy through shared methods
and standardized formats, enhancing collaborative research and minimizing
redundant efforts.

```{r}
#| label: se_sturcture
#| fig-align: center
#| out-width: 80%
#| fig-cap: _SummarizedExperiment_ class
#| echo: false

knitr::include_graphics(here::here("vignettes", "figures", "SE.png"))
```

To integrate microbiome data science within the _SE_ ecosystem, the
_TreeSummarizedExperiment_ (_TreeSE_) was developed.

```{r}
#| label: treese_sturcture
#| fig-align: center
#| out-width: 80%
#| fig-cap: _TreeSummarizedExperiment_ class
#| echo: false


knitr::include_graphics(here::here("vignettes", "figures", "TreeSE.png"))
```

Subsequently, a suite of _mia_* (MIcrobiome Analysis) packages was developed
to provide microbiome-specific methods within the _SE_ ecosystem:

- [_mia_](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/mia.html): Data analysis.
- [_miaViz_](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/miaViz.html): Visualization.
- [_miaSim_](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/miaSim.html): Data simulation.
- [_miaTime_](https://github.com/microbiome/miaTime): Time series analysis (coming soon to Bioconductor).

The framework has been further expanded by various independent developers,
introducing a range of additional methods. For more details, see
[OMA](https://microbiome.github.io/OMA/docs/devel/pages/miaverse.html#sec-packages).

To support microbiome data science, the online book
[Orchestrating Microbiome Analysis with Bioconductor (OMA)](https://microbiome.github.io/OMA/docs/devel)
was created. It offers examples and best practices developed collaboratively,
with plans for its upcoming publication on Bioconductor.

### 2 Demonstration

In this demo, we will follow
[the introductory workflow from OMA](https://microbiome.github.io/OMA/docs/devel/pages/introductory_workflow.html)
by copy-pasting code examples provided there. The goal is to familiarize you with
_TreeSE_ and related methods while introducing you to OMA to support continued
learning beyond the workshop.

1. Set up your local computer or access [an online environment](https://workshop.bioconductor.org/).
2. Go to [the introductory workflow](https://microbiome.github.io/OMA/docs/devel/pages/introductory_workflow.html).
3. Be ready to follow along with the demonstration.

### 3 Q&A and free exploration

Time for discussion. You are also encouraged to explore and run examples from
[OMA](https://microbiome.github.io/OMA/docs/devel/) on your own.

### Thank you for your time!

Thank you for participating in the workshop! Stay tuned for the upcoming
publication of _miaverse_ and continue exploring its capabilities.

For any future questions or additional support, please refer to [the OMA support page](https://microbiome.github.io/OMA/docs/devel/pages/support.html).
